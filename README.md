# My Daily Life  
In this repository, I'm going to add everything I learn here at COEP_CS. Maybe this will help me avoid falling into a slump and keep me motivated as always.

## Day 1

- Revised MIC codes from my Diploma and plan to solve the labs by learning new concepts. I'll also be learning Microprocessor topics from my [repository](https://github.com/ShingareOm/Microprocessor).
